compiled in this here repo is all my solutions to shuttle's christmas code hunt. forgive the silly names, i just want to have fun.

on that note, i probably wouldn't use this repo as an example of my best work.

## original solution do not steal
since i don't want people copypasting my solutions for easy stonks (cmon that's no fun), i'll be pushing them the day after.

## running the dang thing
once you got [rust](https://rustup.rs) and [the shuttle cli](https://docs.shuttle.rs/getting-started/installation) installed, all you need is a cheeky little ``cargo shuttle run`` and you're off to the races!

## omg!! you're using unwrap!!
